                  <p class="card-text">In Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood takes readers into the life of one of the most notorious women of the nineteenth century. 

                    It's 1843, and Grace Marks has been convicted for her involvement in the vicious murders <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    of her employer and his housekeeper and mistress. Some believe Grace is innocent; others think 
                    her evil or insane. Now serving a life sentence, Grace claims to have no memory of the murders. 
                    An up-and-coming expert in the burgeoning field of mental illness is engaged by a group of reformers 
                    and spiritualists who seek a pardon for Grace. He listens to her story while bringing her closer and 
                    closer to the day she cannot remember. What will he find in attempting to unlock her memories?</span></p>

                  <p class="card-text">Set in a small English village during 1812, this classic novel is one of the greatest love stories ever told!
                    A poor country squire is trying to find husbands for his five daughters. When one of them, Elizabeth, meets rich Mr. Darcy 
                    at a <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">dance, they don't find much in common. But during the next few months, they overcome their differences and fall in love.
                    Jane Austen (1775 - 1817) transformed this effervescent tale of rural romance into a witty, shrewdly observed satire of English 
                    country life that is now regarded as one of the principal treasures of English language.
                    aDefying traditional gender norms, Elizabeth’s attitude is seen in the prominent contrast to her female foils within the novel, 
                    namely Caroline, Jane, and Charlotte. Each of these women conforms to the socially imposed norms of Regency England, while Elizabeth 
                    artfully challenges gender inequality.</span></p>

                    <p class="card-text">We are in Naples and this novel takes place over the course of four years only in the late 90, 
                      starring the protagonist Giovanna as she goes from being 12 to 16 years old. She is the
                      single daughter of a petit-bourgeois couple - liberal, secular, and relatively open-minded <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">- living
                      in a respectable neighbourhood reflecting their status. Giovanna's best friends are Ida and
                      Angela, who are also family friends. In a very Ferrante-like gripping opening, Giovanna
                      overhears her dad saying that she is starting to look ugly like his sister Vittoria. Aunt Vittoria is
                      a legendary, witch-like figure in the family annals. Should Giovanna take this
                      comparison as an insult, a condemnation, or a dark prophecy?
                      The harsher lesson Giovanna learns is that men can jeopardize and wreck a woman’s life. Men are
                      capable to shift our self-perception, and become the ultimate jurors of our beauty: the book
                      opens with Giovanna’s dad telling her ‘she looks ugly like her aunt’ and end with another man
                      complimenting on her beautiful she looks. Amongst these mixed messages, she struggles to
                      find her own lenses and self-worth. The novel in some ways suggests that beauty is a value that
                      men have the power to confer or remove from women in their lives. But the ending, in which
                      Giovanna renounces to the allure of man’s poisoning flattery seems to indicate, a subtle,
                      feminist change of direction for our young heroin and possibly, other women in her generation.

                        the fiery and unforgettable Lila and the bookish narrator, Elena, become women, wives, mothers, and leaders, 
                        all the while maintaining a complex and at times conflicted friendship. This first novel in the series follows 
                        Lila and Elena from their fateful meeting as ten-year-olds through their school years and adolescence. 
                        Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it 
                        is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between two women.

                                going under -- maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such <span id="dots10">...</span><span id="more10">intensity that Esther's insanity 
                                becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and 
                                harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made 'The Bell Jar' a haunting American classic.
                                In 1963, Plath's semi-autobiographic novel 'The Bell Jar' was published under the pseudonym "Victoria Lucas"; it was reissued in 1966 under her own name.

                                  almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try. It is written about teens, sure, but the themes are <span id="dots11">...</span><span id="more11"> so universal that anyone who survived 
                                  high school will relate to the lives of the two protagonists. Eleanor is the new girl in town and her wild red hair and patchwork outfits are not helping 
                                  her blend in. She ends up sitting next to Park on the bus, whose tendencies towards comic books don’t jibe with the rest of his family’s love of sports. 
                                  They sit in awkward silence every day until Park notices that Eleanor is reading his comics over his shoulder; he begins to slide them closer to her side 
                                  of the seat and thus begins their love story. Their relationship grows gradually until they both find themselves looking forward to the bus ride more than 
                                  any other part of the day. Things aren’t easy: Eleanor is bullied at school and then goes home to a threatening family situation; Park’s parents do not 
                                  approve of Eleanor’s awkward ways. Ultimately, though, this is a book about two people who just really, really like each other and who believe that they 
                                  can overcome any obstacle standing in the way of their happiness.

                                  Ella Rubenstein is forty years old and unhappily married when she takes a job as a reader for a literary agent. Her first assignment is to read and 
                                  report on Sweet Blasphemy, a novel written by a man named Aziz Zahara. Ella is mesmerized by his tale of Shams's search for Rumi and the dervish's role 
                                  in transforming the successful but unhappy cleric into a committed mystic, passionate poet, and advocate of love. She is also taken with Shams's lessons, 
                                  or rules, that offer insight into an ancient philosophy based on the unity of all people and religions, and the presence of love in each and every one of us. 
                                  As she reads on, she realizes that Rumi's story mir-rors her own and that Zahara—like Shams—has come to set her free.

                                    On the surface, it is a novel of tense and steadily mounting horror; but on a more profound level, it offers searching illumination of the human

                                      black neighbourhood, Garden Heights, where gang membership, drug dealing and shootings are rife. But every day, 16-year-old Starr makes a 45-minute journey 
                                      to a private school in a predominantly white, affluent suburb where she has almost no black friends. The issue is not that she can't fit in there - she has 
                                      plenty of mostly white friends and a steady relationship with her white boyfriend - but rather that she's acutely aware that she's constantly modifying her 
                                      behaviour in order to do so. 
                                      One evening, Starr gets a lift home from a Garden Heights party from her childhood best friend, Khalil. When their car is pulled over by a white police officer,

                                          This is a sensitive, thought provoking, beautifully written book about having to make the choice between reliving 
                                          past memories forever and moving on, and about the power of reading and writing to help us cope with <span id="dots17">...</span><span id="more17">and express

                                          Jam is enrolled in an exclusive class, Special Topics in English. Each semester, the students in this class are 
                                          mysteriously handpicked by the teacher with no rhyme or reason. It's a small class devoted to reading only one 
                                          author the entire semester. While it may seem an odd choice for a school of students with emotional difficulties, 
                                          this semester they'll be reading the work of Sylvia Plath.
                                          
                                          There are four other students in Jam's class, each quite different, but all share the emotional trauma of a 
                                          particular event that pushed their lives off course. The teacher, Mrs. Quenell, gives them two important assignments—they 
                                          must write in the antique journal she gives each of them and return it at the end of the semester, and they must look out 
                                          for each other. Seems easy, and no one can understand why this class is seemingly so exclusive.
                                          
                                          But when Jam starts writing in her journal, she finds herself mysteriously transported back to her life. She can relive 
                                          their old memories, feel his arms around her again, and she finally feels safe and happy. Yet each time this happens, 
                                          it is only for a short period of time, and when it ends, she finds pages of her journal have been inexplicably filled—with 
                                          her handwriting. And this happens to each of her fellow students in the class—each is transported back to the moments before 
                                          the trauma they suffered.

                                          the enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives. 
                                          In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned <span id="dots21">...</span><span id="more21"> — from the layout of the winding roads, 
                                          to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit 
                                          more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules. Enter Mia Warren—an enigmatic artist 
                                          and single mother—who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. 
                                          Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. 
                                          But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.
                                          
                                          When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts 
                                          that dramatically divides the town—and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides.  Suspicious of Mia and her motives, 
                                          Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia’s past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs. 
                                          
                                          „Little Fires Everywhere” explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious 
                                          pull of motherhood — and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.</span></p>

                  the historic Paris Agreement of 2015 - have written a cautionary but optimistic book about the world's changing 
                  climate and the fate <span id="dots22">...</span><span id="more22"> of humanity.
                  How all of us address the climate crisis in the next thirty years will determine not only the world we will live 
                  in but also the world we will bequeath to our children and theirs.
                  The authors outline two possible scenarios for our planet. In one, they describe what life on Earth will be like 
                  by 2050 if we fail to meet the Paris climate targets. In the other, they lay out what it will be like to live 
                  in a carbon neutral, regenerative world. They argue for confronting the climate crisis headon, with determination 
                  and optimism. The Future We Choose presents our options and tells us, in no uncertain terms, what governments, 
                  corporations, and each of us can and must do to fend off disaster.

                <h4 class="card-title">Why I'm no Longer Talking to White People About Race</h4>
                <p class="card-text">Award-winning journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge was 
                  frustrated with the way that discussions of race and racism are so often led by those blind to it, by those willfully 
                  ignorant of its legacy. Her response, Why I’m No Longer Talking to <span id="dots23">...</span><span id="more23"> White People About Race, has transformed the conversation 
                  both in Britain and around the world. Examining everything from eradicated black history to the political purpose of white 
                  dominance, from whitewashed feminism to the inextricable link between class and race, Eddo-Lodge offers a timely and essential 
                  new framework for how to see, acknowledge, and counter racism. This a searing, illuminating, absolutely necessary exploration 
                  of what it is to be a person of color in Britain today, and an essential handbook for anyone looking to understand 
                  how structural racism works.</span></p>
