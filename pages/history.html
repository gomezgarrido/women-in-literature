        <h1 class="main-title-history">A History of Women in Literature</h1>
        <p1>For centuries, male-dominated societies have meant that many women have not had the opportunity to write and those that did had their work largely ignored. The chance to publish was given to men and women’s voices in both fiction and non-fiction text were hugely outnumbered. For many years, writing by women was read mostly by other women.</p1>
        <br>
        <p2>George Eliot is known for iconic novels in the Victorian era including Silas Marner and Middlemarch, yet this was a pen name used by Mary Ann Evans who lived from 1819 to 1880. Although some women in her lifetime were getting published under their real names, Evans wanted her work to be judged equally to male writers of the era, particularly as she was breaking away from stereotypically feminine romance novels.</p2>
        <br>
        <p3>Jane Austen is today one of the best-known English novelists, but her in own lifetime she received little recognition and often published anonymously. Similarly, Virginia Woolf is now a greatly celebrated modernist writer and regarded as a progressive feminist for her era yet her work was not widely read for fifty years after she published it.</p3>
        <br>
        <p4>While feminism in the 1970s and 1980s sparked renewed interest in reading literature written by women, women continue to face barriers. J.K. Rowling, author of the bestselling book series of all-time, was encouraged to use her initials rather than her full name when she published the first Harry Potter book in 1997 to keep the interest of young boys not wanting to read a book written by a woman.</p4>
        <br>
        <p5>Today we must continue to recognise the written work of women, particularly authors who are women of colour or LGBT+ to keep challenging the status quo. How can we understand our society if we do not listen to all voices?</p5>
